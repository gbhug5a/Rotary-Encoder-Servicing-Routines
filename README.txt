Rotary-Encoder-Servicing-Routines

Polling and pin-triggered interrupt servicing routines for quadrature rotary encoders


These routines are efficient and work well with no hardware debouncing.
Encoders with pulses=detents, and pulses=detents/2, are supported.
Examples in assembler are included for the TI MSP430 processors.
Everything is explained in the PDF.
